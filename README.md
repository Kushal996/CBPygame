Short Description about the game:
Chowka Bara is a traditional Indian board game that is often played by two to four players. It is played on a square board with a distinctive cross-shaped pattern. Players take turns rolling dice and moving their pieces around the board in a clockwise direction. The objective is to move all your pieces from your starting area to the central square of your color. Along the way, you can capture your opponents' pieces by landing on the same space they occupy. The first player to successfully move all their pieces to the center of the board wins the game. Chowka Bara combines strategy and luck and is a fun game for people of all ages.
